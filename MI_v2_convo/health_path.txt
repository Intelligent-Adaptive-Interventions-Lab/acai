Yes

I want to be more caring so that I can become a better teacher.

The most important one to me is health.

I was born with a special disease that causes me to grow very slowly, so I've always knew of the importance of personal health.

Being kind to others makes me feel good, especially when others recognize the good deeds you do. I feel that this really helps with my mental health and motivation.
