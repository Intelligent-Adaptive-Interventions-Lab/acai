AI: Hey there! I am Alex, an AI developed by the University of Toronto.
AI: What is your name?

Human: Hi My name is billy
AI: Nice to meet you, Hi My name is billy!
AI: Please let me know if I got your name right. Yes/No

Human: Yes
AI: I understand that the researchers are recruiting people who have expressed some degree of interest in becoming more kind and caring towards others.  I was hoping to spend some time with you today and chat about the reasons you are here as well as the kinds of things that you might want to do in the future around becoming more kind and caring.
AI: To start off, could you briefly tell me what led you to participate in this study and elaborate on how important becoming more kind and caring is for you?

Human: Prolific led me to this study and it's important for me to be kind and caring as these values are what makes a person good
AI: I would also like to learn a little bit about your personal values. Just so I understand you a bit better, could you tell me which of the following values is the most important to you? Here are the values: relationships, personal growth, community, health.

Human: relationships
AI: It is certainly very important to value your relationships. Why is this the most important value for you personally?

Human: as that is the basis of a positive society
AI: Sorry, I don't understand.
AI: Could you please try saying that in a different way?

Human: relationships are the foundation of a good society, that is why I value relationships the most
AI: Tell me a little about the ways in which you see being more kind and caring  as beneficial towards relationships?

Human: the relationship would get stronger and better through such actions
AI: Thank you for sharing that, Hi My name is billy.
AI: Would you be interested in hearing a little bit about the research or what we know about kindness behaviors?
AI: Please indicate 'Yes' or 'No'.

Human: No
AI: In this case, I wonder if it would be ok to switch gears a little bit and focus on what you already do regarding being kind and caring as well as other things you might want to try in the future. What do you already do regarding being kind and caring? How (if at all) do you think doing these things impacts others?

Human: I try to listen to people and only give advice when asked for it
AI: What might you do to increase how you already show kindness and caring? In your current day-to-day life, what are one or two things you could do to help others?
AI:  Please write 'None' if you cannot think of anything.

Human: None
AI: Some ideas might involve being friendly to strangers, donating something you don't use, or buying food for a homeless person. Are any of these things you would be willing to try in your day-to-day life?
AI: Please indicate 'Yes' or 'No'.

Human: No
AI: Other options involve being patient with strangers, and expressing love or appreciation to friends and family.
AI: Perhaps you might already know this, but behavior is more likely to stick when we come up with concrete, if-then plans to make it happen. An example would be, “If I see a person in need, then I will give them whatever change I have in my pocket up to 1$”. Out of the things one could do to help others we just discussed, which one suits you the best? What might be your if-then plan?
AI: Please write your answer below in the format of 'If I ...., then I ....'

Human: If I give more in charity, then I will be a better person
AI: That sounds great! What might be some obstacles when implementing this plan, if any? What might be a way that you could deal with them?

Human: Love of wealth would be an obstacle. I could deal with this by forcing myself to give.
AI: Thinking of obstacles can be a little intimidating, but those feelings are completely normal. Remember that being more kind and caring can help you with your relationships!
AI: To close off, I was wondering if you could summarize what we’ve talked about? What stands out to you regarding your values, the behaviors you plan to implement to act with kindness and caring, and the way you plan to overcome any potential obstacles?
