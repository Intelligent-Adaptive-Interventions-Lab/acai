AI: Hey there! I am Alex, an AI developed by the University of Toronto.
AI: What is your name?

Human: Anagh
AI: Nice to meet you, Anagh!
AI: Please let me know if I got your name right. Yes/No

Human: Yes
AI: I understand that the researchers are recruiting people who have expressed some degree of interest in becoming more kind and caring towards others.  I was hoping to spend some time with you today and chat about the reasons you are here as well as the kinds of things that you might want to do in the future around becoming more kind and caring.
AI: To start off, could you briefly tell me what led you to participate in this study and elaborate on how important becoming more kind and caring is for you?

Human: I realised that there where times where I am not kind because of certain personal situations I have faced which make me more aggressive and mean as I have been hurt but I want to realise that I cannot let out my emotions on others and must remain kind to others.
AI: I would also like to learn a little bit about your personal values. Just so I understand you a bit better, could you tell me which of the following values is the most important to you? Here are the values: relationships, personal growth, community, health.

Human: Relationships
AI: It is certainly very important to value your relationships. Why is this the most important value for you personally?

Human: There is a quote which I hold dear to me, "Your net worth is your network". I have come to the realisation that strong relationships are extremely important in life and you will struggle to get anywhere without good relationships. 
AI: Tell me a little about the ways in which you see being more kind and caring  as beneficial towards relationships?

Human: Being kind and caring builds strong relationships as people realise you are a good person with good intentions - you are a friend. Having friends means you have people that back you up and help you in situations that you need help in because they know that you would do the same for them.
AI: Thank you for sharing that, Anagh.
AI: Would you be interested in hearing a little bit about the research or what we know about kindness behaviors?
AI: Please indicate 'Yes' or 'No'.

Human: Yes
AI: You might already know this, or be aware of it, but being kind and caring towards others can have a significant impact on our overall well-being, too. Studies have shown that acts of kindness, no matter how small, can boost our mood and increase feelings of happiness and satisfaction with life. Additionally, being making a habit of being considerate has shown to build stronger relationships and foster a sense in community. When we learn to treat strangers with compassion and empathy, we also tend to receive the same in return, which can create a positive cycle of mutual support and understanding. So, consider making kindness and caring a part of your daily routine, and notice the positive effects it can have on both yourself and those around you.
AI: If you'd like, take a moment to think about how this may be important in your life, and let me know when you're ready to move on.

Human: I am ready to move on.
AI: With this information in mind, I was wondering if it would be ok to switch gears a little bit and focus on what you already do regarding being kind and caring as well as other things you might want to try in the future. What do you already do regarding being kind and caring? How (if at all) do you think doing these things impacts others?

Human: To be kind and caring, overall I try to be a good listener and socialise with people in a polite manner. I think doing these things makes people understand that they have someone that they can talk to and be supported by.
AI: What might you do to increase how you already show kindness and caring? In your current day-to-day life, what are one or two things you could do to help others?
AI:  Please write 'None' if you cannot think of anything.
