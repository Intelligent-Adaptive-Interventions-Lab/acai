AI: Hey there! I am Alex, an AI developed by the University of Toronto.
AI: What is your name?

Human: Mick
AI: Nice to meet you, Mick!
AI: Please let me know if I got your name right. Yes/No

Human: yes
AI: I understand that the researchers are recruiting people who have expressed some degree of interest in becoming more kind and caring towards others.  I was hoping to spend some time with you today and chat about the reasons you are here as well as the kinds of things that you might want to do in the future around becoming more kind and caring.
AI: To start off, could you briefly tell me what led you to participate in this study and elaborate on how important becoming more kind and caring is for you?

Human: I am participating in this study because I got the chance to and I believe everyone should be kind and caring
AI: I would also like to learn a little bit about your personal values. Just so I understand you a bit better, could you tell me which of the following values is the most important to you? Here are the values: relationships, personal growth, community, health.

Human: relationships
AI: It is certainly very important to value your relationships. Why is this the most important value for you personally?

Human: Because relationships with others can contribute to all of those other values
AI: Tell me a little about the ways in which you see being more kind and caring  as beneficial towards relationships?

Human: You are very unlikely to be able to maintain relationships if you aren't kind and caring towards those people
AI: Thank you for sharing that, Mick.
AI: Would you be interested in hearing a little bit about the research or what we know about kindness behaviors?
AI: Please indicate 'Yes' or 'No'.

Human: no
AI: In this case, I wonder if it would be ok to switch gears a little bit and focus on what you already do regarding being kind and caring as well as other things you might want to try in the future. What do you already do regarding being kind and caring? How (if at all) do you think doing these things impacts others?

Human: I do my best to be kind and caring towards others whenever I get the chance to, I think just doing small things like this can improve others' days
AI: What might you do to increase how you already show kindness and caring? In your current day-to-day life, what are one or two things you could do to help others?
AI:  Please write 'None' if you cannot think of anything.

Human: None
AI: Some ideas might involve being friendly to strangers, donating something you don't use, or buying food for a homeless person. Are any of these things you would be willing to try in your day-to-day life?
AI: Please indicate 'Yes' or 'No'.

Human: Yes
AI: That’s great! Perhaps you might already know this, but behavior is more likely to stick when we come up with concrete, if-then plans to make it happen. An example would be, “If I see a person in need, then I will give them whatever change I have in my pocket up to 1$”. Out of the things you just said that you could do to help others, which one suits you the best? What might be your if-then plan?
AI: Please write your answer in the format of 'If I ...., then I ....'

Human: If I see a homeless person, then I give them whatever I can afford to
AI: That sounds great! What might be some obstacles when implementing this plan, if any? What might be a way that you could deal with them?

Human: My own financial situation. There is not really any way I can deal with this
AI: Thinking of obstacles can be a little intimidating, but those feelings are completely normal. Remember that being more kind and caring can help you with your relationships!
AI: To close off, I was wondering if you could summarize what we’ve talked about? What stands out to you regarding your values, the behaviors you plan to implement to act with kindness and caring, and the way you plan to overcome any potential obstacles?

Human: Nothing in particular
AI: Sorry, I don't understand.
AI: Could you please try saying that in a different way?

Human: I don't know how else to say that..
AI: Thank you very much, Mick! It’s been a pleasure chatting with you today. I hope you found this conversation useful, and I wish you all the best with your plan to achieve your goals!

Human: :)
