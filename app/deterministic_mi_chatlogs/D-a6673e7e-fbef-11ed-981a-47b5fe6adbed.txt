AI: Hey there! I am Alex, an AI developed by the University of Toronto.
AI: What is your name?

Human: ewan
AI: Nice to meet you, ewan!
AI: Please let me know if I got your name right. Yes/No

Human: yes
AI: I understand that the researchers are recruiting people who have expressed some degree of interest in becoming more kind and caring towards others.  I was hoping to spend some time with you today and chat about the reasons you are here as well as the kinds of things that you might want to do in the future around becoming more kind and caring.
AI: To start off, could you briefly tell me what led you to participate in this study and elaborate on how important becoming more kind and caring is for you?

Human: I am here because I like to help researches gather more data and do what I can. I already feel I am very kind however I will always strive to be even more caring and kind as this is something that matters to me alot. 
AI: I would also like to learn a little bit about your personal values. Just so I understand you a bit better, could you tell me which of the following values is the most important to you? Here are the values: relationships, personal growth, community, health.

Human: Relationships 
AI: It is certainly very important to value your relationships. Why is this the most important value for you personally?

Human: I just feel like I always want to treat other people as well as I can and relationships are always held with other people 
AI: Tell me a little about the ways in which you see being more kind and caring  as beneficial towards relationships?

Human: I feel it helps with the mental health of all the people involved in the relationship. Also I also feel it is valuable for people to have somewhere they can open up and share all their own worries
AI: Thank you for sharing that, ewan.
AI: Would you be interested in hearing a little bit about the research or what we know about kindness behaviors?
AI: Please indicate 'Yes' or 'No'.

Human: no
AI: In this case, I wonder if it would be ok to switch gears a little bit and focus on what you already do regarding being kind and caring as well as other things you might want to try in the future. What do you already do regarding being kind and caring? How (if at all) do you think doing these things impacts others?

Human: I often go and visit elderly people who are alone and take time to talk to them and involve them in activities. I feel this makes older people feel more involved in modern society which can often feel very distant to them. I also make sure i check in on my friends to see how they are doing. I think just offering to listen to their worries is huge to them feeling like they have support networks. 
AI: What might you do to increase how you already show kindness and caring? In your current day-to-day life, what are one or two things you could do to help others?
AI:  Please write 'None' if you cannot think of anything.

Human: Make sure I connect with distant friends more often eg ones who are traveling that I have not spoke to in a while 
AI: That’s great! Perhaps you might already know this, but behavior is more likely to stick when we come up with concrete, if-then plans to make it happen. An example would be, “If I see a person in need, then I will give them whatever change I have in my pocket up to 1$”. Out of the things you just said that you could do to help others, which one suits you the best? What might be your if-then plan?
AI: Please write your answer in the format of 'If I ...., then I ....'

Human: My if then plan could be if I see someone who I think may be feeling down I will need to at least message them to ask how they are. 
AI: That sounds great! What might be some obstacles when implementing this plan, if any? What might be a way that you could deal with them?

Human: I may feel nervous about messaging them as they have not heard from me for a while so they may have changed 
AI: Thinking of obstacles can be a little intimidating, but those feelings are completely normal. Remember that being more kind and caring can help you with your relationships!
AI: To close off, I was wondering if you could summarize what we’ve talked about? What stands out to you regarding your values, the behaviors you plan to implement to act with kindness and caring, and the way you plan to overcome any potential obstacles?

Human: We have talked about the ways I value my relationships and how I can improve these through kindness and caring nature in the future. I will need to put aside my insecurities and try and help out anyone who i feel may even be slightly down.  
AI: Thank you very much, ewan! It’s been a pleasure chatting with you today. I hope you found this conversation useful, and I wish you all the best with your plan to achieve your goals!
