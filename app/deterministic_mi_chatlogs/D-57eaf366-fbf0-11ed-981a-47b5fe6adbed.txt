AI: Hey there! I am Alex, an AI developed by the University of Toronto.
AI: What is your name?

Human: Molly
AI: Nice to meet you, Molly!
AI: Please let me know if I got your name right. Yes/No

Human: yes 
AI: I understand that the researchers are recruiting people who have expressed some degree of interest in becoming more kind and caring towards others.  I was hoping to spend some time with you today and chat about the reasons you are here as well as the kinds of things that you might want to do in the future around becoming more kind and caring.
AI: To start off, could you briefly tell me what led you to participate in this study and elaborate on how important becoming more kind and caring is for you?

Human: okie dokie 
AI: I would also like to learn a little bit about your personal values. Just so I understand you a bit better, could you tell me which of the following values is the most important to you? Here are the values: relationships, personal growth, community, health.

Human: personal growth 
AI: It is certainly very important to value your personal growth. Why is this the most important value for you personally?

Human: i think that the more you value yourself and look after yourself the more you can help others 
AI: Tell me a little about the ways in which you see being more kind and caring  as beneficial towards personal growth?

Human: it means that i would be getting treated with the respect i give others 
AI: Thank you for sharing that, Molly.
AI: Would you be interested in hearing a little bit about the research or what we know about kindness behaviors?
AI: Please indicate 'Yes' or 'No'.

Human: yes
AI: You might already know this, or be aware of it, but being kind and caring towards others can have a significant impact on our overall well-being, too. Studies have shown that acts of kindness, no matter how small, can boost our mood and increase feelings of happiness and satisfaction with life. Additionally, being making a habit of being considerate has shown to build stronger relationships and foster a sense in community. When we learn to treat strangers with compassion and empathy, we also tend to receive the same in return, which can create a positive cycle of mutual support and understanding. So, consider making kindness and caring a part of your daily routine, and notice the positive effects it can have on both yourself and those around you.
AI: If you'd like, take a moment to think about how this may be important in your life, and let me know when you're ready to move on.

Human: ready
AI: With this information in mind, I was wondering if it would be ok to switch gears a little bit and focus on what you already do regarding being kind and caring as well as other things you might want to try in the future. What do you already do regarding being kind and caring? How (if at all) do you think doing these things impacts others?

Human: i always make sure people are comfortable in the situation that they are in and help them with what ever they need and never force something they dont want 
AI: What might you do to increase how you already show kindness and caring? In your current day-to-day life, what are one or two things you could do to help others?
AI:  Please write 'None' if you cannot think of anything.

Human: check on new people 
AI: That’s great! Perhaps you might already know this, but behavior is more likely to stick when we come up with concrete, if-then plans to make it happen. An example would be, “If I see a person in need, then I will give them whatever change I have in my pocket up to 1$”. Out of the things you just said that you could do to help others, which one suits you the best? What might be your if-then plan?
AI: Please write your answer in the format of 'If I ...., then I ....'

Human: check on others most days 
AI: Perhaps you might already know this, but behavior is more likely to stick when we come up with concrete, if-then plans to make it happen. An example would be, “If I see a person in need, then I will give them whatever change I have in my pocket up to 1$”. Out of the things one could do to help others we just discussed, which one suits you the best? What might be your if-then plan?
AI: Please write your answer below in the format of 'If I ...., then I ....'

Human: if i check on others then i will have better report with them
AI: That sounds great! What might be some obstacles when implementing this plan, if any? What might be a way that you could deal with them?

Human: i am not that confident but the more i do it it will get easier 
AI: Thinking of obstacles can be a little intimidating, but those feelings are completely normal. Remember that being more kind and caring can help you with your personal growth!
AI: To close off, I was wondering if you could summarize what we’ve talked about? What stands out to you regarding your values, the behaviors you plan to implement to act with kindness and caring, and the way you plan to overcome any potential obstacles?

Human: that creating if then now plans are helpful and the nicer i am to others the better i will be 
AI: Thank you very much, Molly! It’s been a pleasure chatting with you today. I hope you found this conversation useful, and I wish you all the best with your plan to achieve your goals!

Human: thank you
