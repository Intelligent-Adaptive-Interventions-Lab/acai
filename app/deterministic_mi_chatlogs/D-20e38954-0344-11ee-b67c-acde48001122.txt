AI: Hey there! I am Alex, an AI developed by the University of Toronto.
AI: What is your name?

Human: a
AI: Nice to meet you, a!
AI: Please let me know if I got your name right. Yes/No

Human: b
AI: Sorry, your answer did not meet the requirements of the question.

Human: yes
AI: I understand that the researchers are recruiting people who have expressed some degree of interest in becoming more kind and caring towards others.  I was hoping to spend some time with you today and chat about the reasons you are here as well as the kinds of things that you might want to do in the future around becoming more kind and caring.
AI: To start off, could you briefly tell me what led you to participate in this study and elaborate on how important becoming more kind and caring is for you?

Human: sadf asdf we 
AI: I would also like to learn a little bit about your personal values. Just so I understand you a bit better, could you tell me which of the following values is the most important to you? Here are the values: relationships, personal growth, community, health.

Human: sadjf niv hena s ads 
AI: Sorry, your answer did not meet the requirements of the question.

Human: relationships
AI: It is certainly very important to value your relationships. Why is this the most important value for you personally?

Human: relationships
AI: Tell me a little about the ways in which you see being more kind and caring  as beneficial towards relationships?

Human: jjjj
AI: Thank you for sharing that, a.
AI: Would you be interested in hearing a little bit about the research or what we know about kindness behaviors?
AI: Please indicate 'Yes' or 'No'.

Human: no
AI: In this case, I wonder if it would be ok to switch gears a little bit and focus on what you already do regarding being kind and caring as well as other things you might want to try in the future. What do you already do regarding being kind and caring? How (if at all) do you think doing these things impacts others?

Human: kg fyg h
AI: What might you do to increase how you already show kindness and caring? In your current day-to-day life, what are one or two things you could do to help others?
AI:  Please write 'None' if you cannot think of anything.

Human: none
AI: Some ideas might involve being friendly to strangers, donating something you don't use, or buying food for a homeless person. Are any of these things you would be willing to try in your day-to-day life?
AI: Please indicate 'Yes' or 'No'.

Human: no
AI: Other options involve being patient with strangers, and expressing love or appreciation to friends and family.
AI: Perhaps you might already know this, but behavior is more likely to stick when we come up with concrete, if-then plans to make it happen. An example would be, “If I see a person in need, then I will give them whatever change I have in my pocket up to 1$”. Out of the things one could do to help others we just discussed, which one suits you the best? What might be your if-then plan?
AI: Please write your answer below in the format of 'If I ...., then I ....'

Human: if hfhdgx i
AI: It is important to create a plan that reminds you what to do when something specific happens. For example, if I wanted to be more friendly to strangers, I'd say something like "*if* I make eye contact with a stranger, *then* I will smile at them". What might be your if-then plan? 
AI: Please write your answer below in the format of 'If I ...., then I ....'
