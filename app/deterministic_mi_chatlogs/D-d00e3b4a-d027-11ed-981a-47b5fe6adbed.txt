AI: Hey there! I am Alex, an AI developed by the University of Toronto.
AI: What is your name?

Human: Kelly
AI: Nice to meet you, Kelly!
AI: Please let me know if I got your name right. Yes/No

Human: yes
AI: I understand that the researchers are recruiting people who have expressed some degree of interest in becoming more kind and caring towards others.  I was hoping to spend some time with you today and chat about the reasons you are here as well as the kinds of things that you might want to do in the future around becoming more kind and caring.
AI: To start off, could you briefly tell me what led you to participate in this study and elaborate on how important becoming more kind and caring is for you?

Human: Well I took the study by chance. I read the brief and thought it sounded interesting (it has been so far).As for becoming more caring, I have been brought up with the understanding that you treat others how you would like to be treated and so I treat people with kindness and respect.
AI: I would also like to learn a little bit about your personal values. Just so I understand you a bit better, could you tell me which of the following values is the most important to you? Here are the values: relationships, personal growth, community, health.

Human: Relationships
AI: It is certainly very important to value your relationships. Why is this the most important value for you personally?

Human: Because to me family is everything. I also dont have a lot of friends, I have a few but they are really close to me that they practically are family too. I would do anything for my family :)
AI: Tell me a little about the ways in which you see being more kind and caring  as beneficial towards relationships?

Human: Well my family and friends know that if ever they need me for anything I will drop everything and help them no matter what (obviously I meant within reason, im not willing to do anything illegal lol). 
AI: Thank you for sharing that, Kelly.
AI: Would you be interested in hearing a little bit about the research or what we know about kindness behaviors?
AI: Please indicate 'Yes' or 'No'.

Human: yes
AI: You might already know this, or be aware of it, but being kind and caring towards others can have a significant impact on our overall well-being, too. Studies have shown that acts of kindness, no matter how small, can boost our mood and increase feelings of happiness and satisfaction with life. Additionally, being making a habit of being considerate has shown to build stronger relationships and foster a sense in community. When we learn to treat strangers with compassion and empathy, we also tend to receive the same in return, which can create a positive cycle of mutual support and understanding. So, consider making kindness and caring a part of your daily routine, and notice the positive effects it can have on both yourself and those around you.
AI: If you'd like, take a moment to think about how this may be important in your life, and let me know when you're ready to move on.

Human: I am ready
AI: With this information in mind, I was wondering if it would be ok to switch gears a little bit and focus on what you already do regarding being kind and caring as well as other things you might want to try in the future. What do you already do regarding being kind and caring? How (if at all) do you think doing these things impacts others?

Human: test
AI: Sorry, I don't understand.
AI: Could you please try saying that in a different way?

Human: test
AI: Sorry, I don't understand.
AI: Could you please try saying that in a different way?

Human: broken
AI: Sorry, I don't understand.
AI: Could you please try saying that in a different way?

Human: 502
AI: Sorry, I don't understand.
AI: Could you please try saying that in a different way?

Human: I help in any way I can just to make peoples lives easier
AI: What might you do to increase how you already show kindness and caring? In your current day-to-day life, what are one or two things you could do to help others?
AI:  Please write 'None' if you cannot think of anything.
