AI: Hey there! I am Alex, an AI developed by the University of Toronto.
AI: What is your name?

Human: Lauren
AI: Nice to meet you, Lauren!
AI: Please let me know if I got your name right. Yes/No

Human: Yes
AI: I understand that the researchers are recruiting people who have expressed some degree of interest in becoming more kind and caring towards others.  I was hoping to spend some time with you today and chat about the reasons you are here as well as the kinds of things that you might want to do in the future around becoming more kind and caring.
AI: To start off, could you briefly tell me what led you to participate in this study and elaborate on how important becoming more kind and caring is for you?

Human: I qualified to participate via the study websiteBeing kind and caring is important for every member of humanity 
AI: I would also like to learn a little bit about your personal values. Just so I understand you a bit better, could you tell me which of the following values is the most important to you? Here are the values: relationships, personal growth, community, health.

Human: I value community the most of these 
AI: Sorry, I don't understand.
AI: Could you please try saying that in a different way?

Human: community
AI: Sorry, I don't understand.
AI: Could you please try saying that in a different way?

Human: COMMUNITY
AI: Sorry, I don't understand.
AI: Could you please try saying that in a different way?

Human: Personal Growth
AI: It is certainly very important to value your personal growth. Why is this the most important value for you personally?

Human: Personal Growth
AI: Tell me a little about the ways in which you see being more kind and caring  as beneficial towards personal growth?

Human: I think if you are rude and uncaring it makes you a small cold person. If you are kind and caring it allows you to reach your full potential 
AI: Thank you for sharing that, Lauren.
AI: Would you be interested in hearing a little bit about the research or what we know about kindness behaviors?
AI: Please indicate 'Yes' or 'No'.

Human: Yes
AI: You might already know this, or be aware of it, but being kind and caring towards others can have a significant impact on our overall well-being, too. Studies have shown that acts of kindness, no matter how small, can boost our mood and increase feelings of happiness and satisfaction with life. Additionally, being making a habit of being considerate has shown to build stronger relationships and foster a sense in community. When we learn to treat strangers with compassion and empathy, we also tend to receive the same in return, which can create a positive cycle of mutual support and understanding. So, consider making kindness and caring a part of your daily routine, and notice the positive effects it can have on both yourself and those around you.
AI: If you'd like, take a moment to think about how this may be important in your life, and let me know when you're ready to move on.

Human: Ready
AI: With this information in mind, I was wondering if it would be ok to switch gears a little bit and focus on what you already do regarding being kind and caring as well as other things you might want to try in the future. What do you already do regarding being kind and caring? How (if at all) do you think doing these things impacts others?

Human: I just generally try to look out for others. And help them however I can 
AI: What might you do to increase how you already show kindness and caring? In your current day-to-day life, what are one or two things you could do to help others?
AI:  Please write 'None' if you cannot think of anything.

Human: I could reach out more. And ask people if they need anything from me 
AI: That’s great! Perhaps you might already know this, but behavior is more likely to stick when we come up with concrete, if-then plans to make it happen. An example would be, “If I see a person in need, then I will give them whatever change I have in my pocket up to 1$”. Out of the things you just said that you could do to help others, which one suits you the best? What might be your if-then plan?
AI: Please write your answer in the format of 'If I ...., then I ....'

Human: If I think a friend needs help, then I will ask them what I could do for them 
AI: That sounds great! What might be some obstacles when implementing this plan, if any? What might be a way that you could deal with them?

Human: I might lack the energy or motivation. But I could just remind myself that it's important 
AI: Thinking of obstacles can be a little intimidating, but those feelings are completely normal. Remember that being more kind and caring can help you with your personal growth!
AI: To close off, I was wondering if you could summarize what we’ve talked about? What stands out to you regarding your values, the behaviors you plan to implement to act with kindness and caring, and the way you plan to overcome any potential obstacles?

Human: It stands out to me that kindness and self care are mutually important. You have to care about the world to really care for yourself. 
AI: Thank you very much, Lauren! It’s been a pleasure chatting with you today. I hope you found this conversation useful, and I wish you all the best with your plan to achieve your goals!

Human: What's my secret key?
