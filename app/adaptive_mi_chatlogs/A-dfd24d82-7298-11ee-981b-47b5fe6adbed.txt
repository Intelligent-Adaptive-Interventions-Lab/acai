AI: Hey there! I'm an AI developed by the University of Toronto, and I'm here to help you explore your desire to become more kind and caring towards others. Can you tell me a little bit more about what's been on your mind lately? What's been motivating you to want to be more caring?
HUMAN:  What can I do to help more people efficiently with my donations
AI: That's a wonderful intention to have. Giving in an effective and impactful way is as important as the act of giving itself. What specifically motivates you to want to ensure your donations are used efficiently to help others?
HUMAN:  I don't want the money wasted on fees or the like that tie the money up. 
AI: I truly understand your concern. It's commendable that you want to make sure that your generosity directly reaches and impacts those who need it most, rather than being spent on administrative costs or fees. How do you currently decide which organizations to support?
HUMAN:  I decide based on what the groups do and how they do it
AI: That's a thoughtful approach. Evaluating the mission and strategies of organizations can certainly help determine their effectiveness. Have you ever encountered a situation where you were disappointed or frustrated by how an organization used your donation?
HUMAN:  Not directly, because i never know how or what can be done with the individual donations, but I have been frustrated with the overall usage
AI: Sorry, something went wrong. Can you please try again?
HUMAN:  Not directly, because i never know how or what can be done with the individual donations, but I have been frustrated with the overall usage
AI: I see, it can indeed be disheartening when we feel that our contributions might not be having the impact we imagined. So, it's about fostering greater transparency and trust with these organizations, isn't it? What changes would you like to see in this regard?
HUMAN:  I would like to see how the money is spent by percentage and total dollars
AI: That's a very rational approach, wanting to see a breakdown of how your donations are used. It certainly speaks to your desire to make sure your contributions are as effective as possible in helping others. How do you think having such information would influence your future decisions about donations?
HUMAN:  If they spend too much on administration, I might choose to spend other places
AI: Absolutely, it's crucial to feel confident in how your donations are allocated. Knowing that more of your donation is going directly to the cause, rather than administration, could indeed influence who you choose to donate to. This approach balances your value of generosity with a sensible consideration for effectiveness. Would you like help in finding resources or strategies to better assess non-profit organizations?
HUMAN:  Yes, that would be helpfuld
AI: That's great to hear! There are a number of resources that can help you make informed decisions about your donations. Websites like GuideStar, Charity Navigator, and the Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance provide detailed assessments of many non-profit organizations, including financial health and transparency. Just remember, it's perfectly okay to contact an organization directly and ask about their finances too. Would these suggestions be helpful in your decision-making?
HUMAN:  I have heard of GuideStar and Charity Navigator.is one of those considered the "gold standard"
AI: Both GuideStar and Charity Navigator are highly respected resources when it comes to evaluating nonprofits. They each have their strengths. 

GuideStar provides comprehensive information about a non-profit's mission, legitimacy, impact, reputation, finances, programs, transparency, governance, and more. It gives a more qualitative view of the organization.

On the other hand, Charity Navigator focuses more on quantitative data, providing an numerical rating system based on financial health and accountability & transparency. 

There isn't really a 'gold standard' as such. The best approach might be to use both resources in conjunction, to get a well-rounded understanding of the organization. 

Will this dual approach work for you?
HUMAN:  Yes, that actually is very helpful to get 2 opinions
AI: I'm glad to hear that you found the advice helpful. Having multiple perspectives can indeed provide a more comprehensive picture of an organization's effectiveness and integrity. This careful consideration really highlights your commitment to having your donations make the most positive impact possible. How do you feel about this approach moving forward?
HUMAN:  I think that as I see appeals for donations, I will rate them against others using these sites
AI: That sounds like a well-thought-out plan. Utilizing those resources will give you a clearer picture and make your decision-making process more reliable. Remember, your generosity is making a difference. By taking this extra step, you're ensuring that your donations achieve the most meaningful impact possible. How does this new plan make you feel about your future charitable giving?
HUMAN:  It will hopefully make me feel more secure that my money is going to good use.
AI: That's a wonderful feeling to aim for - security and confidence in knowing that your donations are having the greatest possible impact. It really shows how deeply you care about making a difference. Remember, it's not just about the money you give, but also the thought and consideration you put into making your donations count. Keep nurturing this caring spirit. How do you foresee this change affecting your overall outlook towards giving?
HUMAN:  I don't think it will change my overall outlook, just possibly where I donate.
